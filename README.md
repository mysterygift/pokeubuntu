# Pokémon Ubuntu

## What is this?

I'm currently dabbling in the pokeemerald disassembly. Huge thanks to DizzyEgg & Lunos over at pokécommunity for your brilliant tutorials as well as the pokeemerald-expansion. Saves me solving merge conflicts!

## Where can I find out more about the project?

At the moment? Nowhere, frankly I'm surprised you've even found this. When I have something worth showing off I'll make a post on the pokécommunity forums. That will probably be when I have a sizeable demo ready. In the meantime, I'm a film producer and photographer who you can find on Instagram @arandavies. See you there.
